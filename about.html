	<h1>About Me!</h1>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<h2>My name is Michael Van Orman, and I've been studying art since high school. While I didn't draw or make much art when I was younger, I found my love for art in a 9th grade digital art class.
		After that, I eventually got into the Chesterfield County Tech Center in my senior year, and would get into Brightpoint community college where I currently study.</h2>
		
		<h2>I hope that in the future I can display my skills for many to see, whether that be via graphic design to gallery work.</h2>
		
		<h2>In my spare time, I like to play video games and journal. I've been journaling for about 2.5 years now, and I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone! It has really helped me appreciate the little things more.</h2>
